# adventofcode

2022 :
  My first year participating ! 
(It's also my first year at the university, so all I know is what I've learned by myself.)

For me it's not about speed, I just want to try and complete every challenge !
I did it ! I have to admit I did not do everything without any hints, because I often did not have the time or energy to spend hours looking for a magical modulo or something like that. I wrote all my code, I just looked a few times at some explanations and optimisations.

By the look of things, I have a LOT to learn !!
