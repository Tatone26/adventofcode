2022 :
  My first year participating ! 
(It's also my first year at the university, so all I know is what I've learned by myself.)

For me it's not about speed, I just want to try and complete every challenge ! That would already be quite an achievement to get to the last day !

(Oh, and I might try to learn some Rust redoing the problems :) )
