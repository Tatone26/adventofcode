# ADVENTOFCODE 2024

This year, working on my C code :)

A few things I force myself to do : 
- Go for SPEED. All code should be as fast as possible, and hopefully my computer can run all days cumulated in under 1 sec !
- I try to use nothing but STD, just for the challenge !
- Never change the major input in-place. Need to copy it first.
- Valgrind should be happy. 
- I try to make my code relatively safe.
- I removed all "scanf is insecure" or "memcpy is insecure" from Microsoft's extension because I don't want to use their _s functions.
