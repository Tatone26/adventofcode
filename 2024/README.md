# ADVENTOFCODE 2024

This year, working on my C code :)

I'm also : 
- Trying to optimise my code, hopefully being able to run the entire event in less than a second.
- All input reading - and basic parsing like atoi - is not counted in the measured time.
- Not being very careful security wise (no checks for the return value of malloc for example).
- No sharing info between parts : if part one had to sort the input, part two must too. This leads to a lot of duplicated code.
- Not using any external library, just the normal stdlib.
