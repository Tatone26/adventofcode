# ADVENTOFCODE 2024

This year, working on my C code :)

A few things I force myself to do : 
- Go for SPEED. All code should be as fast as possible, and hopefully my computer can run all days cumulated in under 1 sec ! (My hopes aren't high)
- *All input reading and parsing* is **NOT** part of the measured time, **unless the parsing is the difficulty** (ex: Day 3)
- I try to use nothing but the standard libc, because it's more challenging ! 
- Never change the input in-place. Need to copy it first, which could take some time in every part.
- Valgrind should be perfectly happy with everything.
- I removed all "scanf is insecure" or "memcpy is insecure" from Microsoft's extension because I don't want to use their _s functions.
